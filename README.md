# Circles of Hell (WIP)

## Introduction
This is a work in progress web game I am creating to get myself acquainted with Javascript, its rules, and its conventions as an interpreted language.

The game is a simple shooter. All you need to do is make it to the end without dying.

## WIP Status
At the moment, the game is severely limited in terms of design and gameplay. Below is a list of planned features.

* Boss (2/5 phases complete)
* A preceding level
* Sound effects
* Music
* Improved graphics
* Bombs (Will clear all bullets on screen and deal massive damage to enemies. Only two per life.)
* Different shot types (Only has straight shot so far.)

## Controls
The controls for this game are listed below the screen in the html page.

* Arrow keys: Movement
* Z key: OK, shoot
* X key: Cancel, bomb (not yet implemented)
* Esc: Pause or resume
* R key: Restart game if paused
